# Monitor containerized apps

## Embedded Agent
The [embedded agent demo](embedded-agent) shows how the Agent can be included directly in an image.

## Volume Mount
The [error generator](error-generator) demo app contains an example [volume mount config file](error-generator/volume-mount.yaml).

## Pod Preset
Three demo apps - [error generator](error-generator), [shopping cart](shopping-cart), and [pet clinic](pet-clinic) - have pod and deployment examples that will pick up the pod preset defined in *[Create a Pod Preset for the Agent](../agent)*.
